## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark red (#8B0000) to reflect the character's color scheme and the forest's twilight.
- Background color: Desaturated dark gray (#333333) for a dim and slightly ominous forest feel.
- Accent color: A muted orange (#D2691E), similar to the leaves of the trees, to draw focus to interactive elements such as the Chop button.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look; suitable for displaying the score.
- Simple, clean icons for any UI elements, consistent with a fantasy game interface.
- Scoreboard at the top-center, 'Chop' button at the bottom-center. The UI will partially mimic the environment of the example image.
- Axe chopping animation triggered on the button click, with the tree visibly reducing upon each successful chop.
